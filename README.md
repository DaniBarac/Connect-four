# Connect Four

This is a simple implementation of the game 'Connect Four', in which the aim is to place 4 pieces of your color in a row on a grid before your oponent does. It features a basic AI that finds the best move by using a minmax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to step through all the possible moves down to a predefined depth.

The project also contains an incomplete implementation of a hash table. The AI, however, uses std::unordered-map for now.
